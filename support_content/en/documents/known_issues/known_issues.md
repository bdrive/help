### File listing (WebDAV, FTP/FTPS/ SFTP)

For WebDAV, FTP/FTPS, SFTP protocols file list reloading from server will be blocked for a folder where files are being uploaded. File listing for other folders are working without any limits.

Because of this limitations, files uploaded to **the same folder** from other users will be shown when file uploading is finised.

### File system is not available (macOS)

When you cannot mount remote storage on macOS

NetDrive needs to register a virtual device for user to access virtual file systems. The number of available virtual device slots are limited by macOS. So if you are using other softwares that uses these device slots NetDrive will not be able to register its virtual device and it cannot connect to remote storages.

You can list currently registered virtual devices using following command.

    $ kextstat

It can list more than hundred devices registered to your system (YMMV).

Use following command to list only third party devices.

    $ kextstat | grep -v com.apple

You can unload kext using following command.

    $ sudo kextunload -b com.company.virtualfilesystem

After unload some kexts please install NetDrive again to register NetDrive virtual device.

### Locked files shown to be deleted (Windows)

From NetDrive 3.9 we supports file locking. Locked files cannot be overwritten, renamed or deleted. On Windows operating system when you try to delete locked file it is deleted and will disappear from Windows Explorer but actually the file is not removed from your server. After refresh or remount you can find your file again.

This is a known issue and we are looking for the solution.

### Failed to upgrade from 3.7 and below (Windows)

If you have problem when upgrading from NetDrive 3.7 and below please uninstall first and install recent version.

### Failed to unzip on Finder (macOS)

macOS tries to create a temporary folder in parent folder and unzip files into the temporary folder.

Unzip fails if the zip files is located at the root folder or a folder where it's parent folder cannot create a temporary folder (like top most folder of Synology WebDAV).

In this case move the zip file to subdirectories, unzip the file and move back the unzipped files. It's better to move the zip file to your local hard disk for unzipping.

## S3 compatible storages

Your S3 compatible storage must support DNS based bucket naming.
