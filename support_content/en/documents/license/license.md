### **NetDrive3 License**

Each customer needs to [**Create Account ID**](#create-account-id) in order to purchase and login to NetDrive3 software. Unlike our previous versions, NetDrive3 does not use license number anymore and it always needs to be connected to the Internet while using.

A trial version is available in [**Bdrive website**](https://www.netdrive.net/store) and it is recommended to check our software prior to the purchase.

‘**License**’ is defined as the number of software that can be used concurrently in any device, and each customer can purchase as many licenses as needed.

Once the license purchase is successfully completed, no-reply confirmation email is immediately sent to user account ID along with the invoice link. Useful license information can also be found in [**Account Site**](#account-site).

_Note: Each account ID can purchase only one license type._

### **Plans**

NetDrive3 has two kinds of plans, Personal and Team, which can be found in [**Bdrive website**](http://www.netdrive.net/store).

- [‘**Personal Plan**’](http://www.netdrive.net/store/store/) is generally for personal use which allows only a single account ID whether customer purchases one or multiple licenses. In case of multiple Personal licenses, _same drive items_ are used among the devices and mounted drives/contents are accessible to other Windows users on the same device.

- [‘**Team Plan**’](http://www.netdrive.net/store/#nav-2) can have respective account ID for each Team member. After the purchase, Team admin must [**Add Team Member**](/support/?type=documents&page=team&from=local#add-team-member) in [**Account Site**](#account-site). Unlike Personal plan, each Team member has _their own drive items_ and mounted drives are not visible to other Windows users on the same devices.

### **License Types**

Two types of NetDrive3 licenses are available, subscription based and onetime purchase.

- ‘**Yearly Subscription**’ can use the license during subscription period along with customer support and version update. It is very important to know about [**Subscription Auto-Renewal**](#subscription-auto-renewal) which will be auto-charged on the initial purchased day of next year, using the same payment method.

- ‘**Lifetime License**’ literally can be used during product lifetime with selection of ‘_support and update_’ period, either 1 year or lifetime.

  - In case of **‘1 year’ support and update option**, the license can be used for product lifetime with limited support and update of 1 year. For the customers who further need support and update after 1 year expired, additional [**Lifetime Support Option**](#lifetime-support-option) is available. Detailed information can be found in the article ['What happens to my one-time license (prior product name of current Lifetime license with 1 year support) after 1 year?'](https://support.bdrive.com/t/what-happens-to-my-one-time-license-after-1-year/92018).

  - In case of **‘lifetime’ support and update option**, the license will last during product lifetime along with support and update.

_Note: Personal plan offers both 1 year and lifetime support option whereas Team plan offers lifetime option only._

### **Add License**

License can be added to initial purchase order at 'Add license' price. The purchase can be proceeded in [**License category in Account Site**](https://accounts.bdrive.com/plans_products/NetDrive3).

When placing an add license order, the followings will be proceeded :

- ‘**Yearly Subscription**’ will first cancel current (initial or the most recent) purchase order by partial refunding applying ‘prorate’, counting from initial or the most recent purchase day. Then a new Yearly Subscription purchase order will be issued for total license quantities at adjusted total price for 1 new year. It is important to know that the renewal day is now changed to this day as explained in [**Subscription Auto-Renewal**](#subscription-auto-renewal).

- ‘**Lifetime License**’ will issue individual purchase order for each add license request at corresponding add license price.

_Note: Yearly Subscription allows to 'Remove license' purchased within 14 days according to refund policy._

_Note: Support and update period of added licenses of Lifetime license for 1 year will comply with the license period of 'initial' purchase order (not add license period). Support and update for Yearly Subscription lasts during subscription period._

_Note: Remove license of Yearly Subscription is limited one time per day._

_Note: Refund can be proceeded within 2 weeks of purchased day based on our [**Refund Policy**](#refund-policy)._

Yearly Subscription continues yearly base by auto-charging on the initial purchase day of each successive year, using the same payment method. A renewal order will be issued and emailed to user account ID.

User is required to check the expiration date of the credit card before annual auto-charge transaction is proceeded since otherwise it will fail the renewal which eventually leads to the cancellation of the entire subscription immediately. Our customers will receive renewal notification email 7 days prior to the renewal date advising about upcoming auto-charge, so it is important to double check card information including the expiration date. Change Credit Card is available in [**Change Credit Card**](#change-credit-card).

For any reason, if you need to stop yearly subscription, check [**End Subscription**](#end-subscription) and [**Refund Policy**](#refund-policy) first and then write to our [**Support Site**](#support-site) with account ID and transaction ID.
